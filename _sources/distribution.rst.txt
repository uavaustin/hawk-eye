Distribution
===============================================

The goal of ``hawk_eye`` is to create a python package that can be utilized by
the `Orchestra <https://github.com/uavaustin/orchestra>`_ subteam. This documentation
aims to give developers of ``hawk_eye`` a sense of how the distribution of this package
is currently managed.

The python package is defined by the ``setup.py`` script at the root of the repo. Inside
there you will see how the package is defined. The ``PrepareModels`` class looks for the
timestamps of the production models defined in ``hawk_eye/core/production_models.py`` and
downloads them. The package is partially defined by ``MANIFEST.in`` file.

You can run the build locally with
::
    ./setup.py bdist_wheel

Also, the tests from ``test.test_inference`` are included in the package to ensure the
application runs. These tests can be run with
::
    ./setup.py test

Automatic Distribution

It's tedious to manually handle the package building an distribution, so a Github Actions
workflow was created.
`This <https://github.com/uavaustin/hawk-eye/blob/master/.github/workflows/create_release.yaml>`_
automatically builds the release under two conditions:
    1. The code is merged into master
    2. The version inside ``version.txt`` has been changed to a git tag that does not exist.

So, whenever something related to our package changes, update the version and merge into
master after a proper PR review. You should find after a couple minutes, a release tag,
release, and package are added to the
`release page <https://github.com/uavaustin/hawk-eye/releases>`_.
